      <p>
        Well, hello there! If you couldn't tell from the big, bright heading, my name is Naomi Lounsbury. I am a budding developer who took the roundabout road to the developer path. </p>
        <p>Before getting into my super exciting education background, you should probably know a little about me. My pronouns are she/her. I'm an extrovert and Aquarius and my favorite word is "dude." Honestly I'm a walking cliche. My hobbies include hiking, traveling and reading the trashiest romance, science fiction and fantasy around. If its absurd with gaping plot holes, I'm into it. I love politics with a passion and will fact-check everything. We have all of human knowledge at our fingertips so why not fact-check Great Aunt Helen's belief that vaccines cause infertility.</p>
       <p> In college, I double majored in Anthropology and Chinese thinking that the job opportunities would just be flowing in. </p>
        <p>Haha, no such luck.</p>
        <p>After my illustrious college career, I went off to China for eight years. Yes, you read that right, eight years. While in China, I earned my Masters in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language, taught kindergarten and wrote for a magazine. That was a grand time but while it was an easy life, it was not a career. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I decided to leave China to pursue a life outside the bubble of China. Sadly my job skills were lacking but upon reaching the golden shores of California, I enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension program for coding and I'm now on my way to becoming a fullstack developer.</p>
