      </h2>

      <p>
        Well, hello there! If you couldn't tell from the big, bright heading, my name is Naomi Lounsbury. I am a budding developer who took the roundabout road to the developer path. </p>
        <p>Before getting into my super exciting education background, you should probably know a little about me. My pronouns are she/her. I'm an extrovert and Aquarius and my favorite word is "dude." My hobbies include hiking, traveling and reading the trashiest romance, science fiction and fantasy around. If its absurd with gaping plot holes, I'm into it. I love politics with a passion and will fact-check everything. We have all of human knowledge at our fingertips so why not fact-check Great Aunt Helen's belief that vaccines cause infertility.</p>
       <p> In college, I double majored in Anthropology and Chinese thinking that the job opportunities would just be flowing in. </p>
        <p>Haha, no such luck.</p>
        <p>After my illustrious college career, I went off to China for eight years. Yes, you read that right, eight years. While in China, I earned my Masters in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language, taught kindergarten and wrote for a magazine. That was a grand time but while it was an easy life, it was not a career. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I decided to return to the US to pursue a life outside the bubble of China. Sadly, my job skills were lacking. So upon reaching the golden shores of California, I enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension program for coding and I'm now on my way to becoming a fullstack developer.</p>

              <p>In this project, my group and I used server-side apis to create a website to search events and hotels in a city of your choice. We used four apis to get events, hotels and even weather on the page. We used materialize as a css framework and thought we did a pretty good job of pulling everything together.  </p>
