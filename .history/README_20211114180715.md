# Portfolio-Naomi
## This is my portfolio. I worked really hard on it and at first enjoyed it. Then things wouldn't go in the right spots and I stopped enjoying it. I tried to try out as many things as I could in CSS but some things didn't work for me so I had to go back to the simple format 

## I definitely don't understand flexboxes.
